    summary: |
      
      I have over 11 years experience... in data modelling / machine learning

      As Principal Researcher at Realizeit, I lead the research and analytics teams. 
      My research powers the models that underpin Realizeit’s personalized learning 
      engine. I also work with academic researchers to better understand the impact 
      and opportunities related to the usage of the Realizeit engine and adaptive 
      learning in general. You can read about some of my work at Realizeit [here](https://lab.realizeitlearning.com/).
